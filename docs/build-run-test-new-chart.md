## 1. Check out the correct branches on both repositories.

Branches:

    • paired-bar-chart
    • similarity-map (will be there in near future)
    • chord-diagram (will be there in near future)

One example for paired bar chart:

In [RawGraphs Charts Repo](https://github.com/blindguardian50/rawgraphs-charts) AND in [RawGraphs App Repo](https://github.com/blindguardian50/rawgraphs-app), checkout branch “paired-bar-chart”


## 2. Creating a build and testing locally in RAWGraphs app:

At rawgraphs-chart repository:

Go to section [Creating a build and testing locally in RAWGraphs app](https://github.com/blindguardian50/rawgraphs-charts/blob/read-me-infovis/docs/add-a-new-chart.md#creating-a-build-and-testing-locally-in-rawgraphs-app) in 
[Adding a new Chart](https://github.com/blindguardian50/rawgraphs-charts/blob/master/docs/add-a-new-chart.md) readme.

Then follow the instructions there but keep in mind that if you checked out the correct branch in rawgraphs-app earlier you will not have to make any changes in src/charts.js anymore, this was already done for you.
